    # All new code is stored in internal/development. Release from public/master will merge changes from internal/development into
    # public/master, then run semantic-release on public/master to update changelog and release notes. Before semantic-release publishes
    # to npm, it builds the dist/ folder. Finally, commits from public/master are synced back to internal/master and internal/development.

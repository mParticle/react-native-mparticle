    # All new code is stored in internal/development. Release from public/main will merge changes from internal/development into
    # public/main, then run semantic-release on public/main to update changelog and release notes. Before semantic-release publishes
    # to npm, it builds the dist/ folder. Finally, commits from public/main are synced back to internal/main and internal/development.
